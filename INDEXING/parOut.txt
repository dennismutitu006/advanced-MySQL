The following example shows a simple stored procedure that uses an OUT parameter. Within the procedure MySQL MAX() function
retrieves maximum salary from MAX_SALARY of jobs table.
mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE my_proc_OUT (OUT highest_salary INT)
-> BEGIN
-> SELECT MAX(MAX_SALARY) INTO highest_salary FROM JOBS;
-> END$$
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

After calling the procedure the word OUT tells the DBMS that the value goes out from the PROCEDURE.
Here highest_salary is the name of the output parameter and we have passed its value to a session variable named @M, in the CALL statement.
CALL my_proc_OUT(@M)$$

mysql< SELECT @M$$+-------+
| @M    |
+-------+
| 40000 |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
