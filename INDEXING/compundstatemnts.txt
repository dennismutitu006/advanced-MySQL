MySQL have following compound statements :

BEGIN ... END Compound-Statement
Statement Label
DECLARE
Variables in Stored Programs
Flow Control Statements
Cursors
Condition Handling

BEGIN ... END Compound-Statement Syntax
 is used to write compound statements, i.e. when you need more than one statement within stored programs (e.g. stored procedures, functions, triggers, and events).

[begin_label:] 
BEGIN     
[statement_list] 
END 
[end_label])

statement_list : It represents one or more statements terminated by a semicolon(;). The statement_list itself is optional, so the empty compound statement BEGIN END is valid.
Label Statement

Labels are permitted for BEGIN ... END blocks and for the LOOP, REPEAT, and WHILE statements. Here is the syntax :
[begin_label:] 
BEGIN    
[statement_list]  
END [end_label]    
[begin_label:] 
LOOP      
statement_list  
END LOOP 
[end_label]    
[begin_label:] 
REPEAT            
statement_list  
UNTIL search_condition  
END 
REPEAT [end_label]    
[begin_label:] 
WHILE search_condition 
DO           
statement_list  
END WHILE 
[end_label]

Label use for those statements which follows following rules:

begin_label must be followed by a colon
begin_label can be given without end_label. If end_label is present, it must be the same as begin_label
end_label cannot be given without begin_label.
Labels at the same nesting level must be distinct
Labels can be up to 16 characters long.
