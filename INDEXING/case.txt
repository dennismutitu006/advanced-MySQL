he CASE statement is used to create complex conditional construct within stored programs.
It cannot have an ELSE NULL clause, and it is terminated with END CASE
syntax
CASE case_value    
WHEN when_value THEN statement_list         
[WHEN when_value THEN statement_list] ...         
[ELSE statement_list] END CASE

or 
CASE        
WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list   
[WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list] ...        
[ELSE statement_list] END CASE

Explanation: First syntax
- case_value is an expression.
- This value is compared to the when_value expression in each WHEN clause until one of them is equal.
- When an equal when_value is found, the corresponding THEN clause statement_list executes.
- If no when_value is equal, the ELSE clause statement_list executes, if there is one.

Explanation: Second syntax
- Each WHEN clause search_condition expression is evaluated until one is true, at which point its corresponding THEN clause statement_list executes.
- If no search_condition is equal, the ELSE clause statement_list executes, if there is one.
- Each statement_list consists of one or more SQL statements; an empty statement_list is not permitted.
